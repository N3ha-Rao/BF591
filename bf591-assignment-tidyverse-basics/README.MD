# Tidyverse Basics

**Problem Statement**
This assignment will focus on basic functions of R with an emphasis on tidyverse implementations. tidyverse is a collection of packages, pioneered by Hadley Wickham and RStudio, that looks to standardize procedures, functionality, and syntax in R.

To gain familiarity with R, we will be working with a microarray dataset that contains gene probe expression data for various samples collected from cancer patients. In bioinformatics, it is common to have multiple datasets for your different modes of data (i.e. microarray expression data is kept separate from clinical data detailing the samples). You will get an opportunity to work with both of these datasets, and be required to cross reference between the two.


**Learning Objectives and Skill List**
- Install various packages needed for analysis
- Load Data
- Gain familiarity with common tidyverse operations such as groupby(), mutate, and summarize.
- Create a small plot to display results
- Utilize R Markdown to create an attractive format for sharing data.
